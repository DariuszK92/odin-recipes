                <li>
                    In a large pot, bring water to a boil. 
                    Stir in the salt until dissolved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the pasta to the water, stir a few times to prevent the
                     noodles from sticking together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cook according to package directions, stirring occasionally, 
                    until al dente or softer depending on desired texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain and toss with desired sauce. If using the pasta in a salad, 
                    add to a colander and rinse with cold water for about 1 minute, 
                    stirring until cooled down.
