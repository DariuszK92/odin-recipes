        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
                <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
                <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
                    (omit if cooking pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven)
                </li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li> teaspoon sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>
                    Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer.
                     Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for
                      5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.
                      <br/>
                      After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely.
                       The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that 
                       the yeast is still active and alive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the
                     mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. 
                     Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
                    <br/>
                    Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook
                     about 7-10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl.
                     Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it
                      gets coated with the oil.
                    <br/>
                    At this point you can choose how long you want the dough to
                    ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge)
                     will result in more complex flavors in the dough.
                     <br/>
                      A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.
                    <br/>
                    Cover the dough with plastic wrap.
